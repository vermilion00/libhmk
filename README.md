## Features

- [x] **Analog Input**: Customizable actuation point for each key and many other features.
- [x] **Rapid Trigger**: Register a key press or release based on the change in key position and the direction of that change
- [x] **Continuous Rapid Trigger**: Deactivate Rapid Trigger only when the key is fully released.
- [x] **Null Bind (SOCD + Rappy Snappy)**: Monitor 2 keys and select which one is active based on the chosen behavior.
- [x] **Dynamic Keystroke**: Assign up to 4 keycodes to a single key. Each keycode can be assigned up to 4 actions for 4 different parts of the keystroke.
- [x] **Tap-Hold**: Send a different keycode depending on whether the key is tapped or held.
- [x] **Toggle**: Toggle between key press and key release. Hold the key for normal behavior.
- [x] **N-Key Rollover**: Support for N-Key Rollover and automatically fall back to 6-Key Rollover in BIOS.
- [x] **Automatic Calibration**: Automatically calibrate the analog input without requiring user intervention.
- [x] **EEPROM Emulation**: No external EEPROM required. Emulate EEPROM using the internal flash memory.
- [x] **Web Configurator**: Configure the firmware using [hmkconf](https://github.com/peppapighs/hmkconf) without needing to recompile the firmware.
- [x] **Tick Rate**: Customizable tick rate for Tap-Hold and Dynamic Keystroke.
- [x] **8kHz Polling Rate**: Support for 8kHz polling rate on some microcontrollers (e.g., AT32F405xx).
- [ ] **Gamepad**: Support for gamepad functionality.

## Limitations

- **RGB Lighting**: The firmware does not support RGB lighting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (Optional, for generating the distance lookup table)

### Building the Firmware

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peppapighs/libhmk.git
```

2. Open the project in PlatformIO, for example, through Visual Studio Code.

3. Create a directory for your keyboard under `src/keyboards/` and create a `config.h` file with the required configurations. An example [`keyboards/he60/config.h`](keyboards/he60/config.h) is provided. See the header files in [`include/`](include/) and [`hardware/`](hardware/) for the available options.

4. Configure the `platformio.ini` file for your keyboard. An example configuration is available at `keyboards/<KEYBOAD_NAME>/pio.ini`. The configuration file includes the following sections:

   - `env`: Shared configuration for all environments. The following options are configurable:
     - `debug_tool` (Optional): See [Debugging](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/debug/index.html).
     - `upload_protocol` (Optional): See [Upload](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/upload/index.html).
   - `env:<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>`: Configuration specific to your keyboard. An example `env:he60` is provided. The following options are configurable:
     - `board`: The microcontroller used by your keyboard. See [Platform](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/platform/index.html).
     - `board_build.f_cpu` (Optional): The clock frequency of the microcontroller if it is not the default value. See [Platform](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/platform/index.html).
     - `build_flags`: Flags passed to the compiler. Include the path to the hardware-specific header files and the configuration file for your keyboard that you created in the previous step. See [Build](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/build/index.html).
     - `build_src_filter`: Filter for the source files. Include the path to the hardware-specific source files. See [Build](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/build/index.html).
     - `framework`: Framework used by the implementation of the hardware-specific code. See [Platform](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/platform/index.html).
     - `platform`: Platform used by the implementation of the hardware-specific code. See [Platform](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/platform/index.html).

5. (Optional) Since the relationship between the ADC value and the key travel distance is non-linear, a lookup table is used to assist the conversion between the two. The table can be found in [`include/distance.h`](include/distance.h). The table `distance_table` is generated by running the Python script [`distance_lut.py`](distance_lut.py). To adjust the table for your keyboard, you should sample the ADC values at various key travel distances, and add the samples to [this Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nzl6twp6ui). The samples can be obtained from the Debug tab of [hmkconf](https://github.com/peppapighs/hmkconf). You are minimally required to add the samples for a fully released key, and a fully pressed key. Fit the curve to obtain the coefficient `a`, which is required to run the script. The script will generate the table for you to replace the existing one.

6. Build the firmware using PlatformIO.

7. Flash the firmware to your keyboard through PlatformIO upload, the bootloader of your keyboard, or any other method.

8. Configure the keyboard using [hmkconf](https://github.com/peppapighs/hmkconf).

## Development

The development branch is `dev`, which contains the latest features and bug fixes. The corresponding `dev` branch of [hmkconf](https://github.com/peppapighs/hmkconf/tree/dev) deployed at [https://hmkdev.prasertsuk.com](https://hmkdev.prasertsuk.com) is required to configure the `dev` branch of the firmware. To contribute, please create a pull request against the `dev` branch.

## Debugging

In addition to the debugging options provided by PlatformIO, you can use the `log_printf` function to log messages to the console. This function is available when:

- The `LOG_ENABLED` macro is defined in the keyboard's `config.h` file, or in `platformio.ini` under the `build_flags` section.
- The `printf` library is included in `platformio.ini` under the `lib_deps` section as follows:

  ```patch
  ...
  - lib_deps = https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb.git#0.18.0
  + lib_deps =
  +   https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb.git#0.18.0
  +   https://github.com/peppapighs/printf.git
  ...
  ```

The log messages will be sent to the HID interface, which can be viewed in [hid_listen](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/hid_listen.html), [QMK CLI](https://docs.qmk.fm/cli_commands#qmk-console), or [QMK Toolbox](https://qmk.fm/toolbox) (buggy, not recommended).

## Porting

See [`hardware/stm32f446xx`](hardware/stm32f446xx/) and [`src/hardware/stm32f446xx`](src/hardware/stm32f446xx/) for an example implementation of the hardware-specific code for the STM32F446xx microcontroller.
